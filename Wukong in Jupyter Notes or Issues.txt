Wukong in Jupyter Notebook Notes

- AWS_Setup Script works great in Jupyter Notebook, so long as boto3 and AWS CLI are properly setup
  - Script fails if Lambda function already exists. It's the last thing the script does, so it works OK, but still

- While 'sam buld --use-container' works fine in notebook, 'sam deploy --guided' requires user input, and thus must be performed outside of Jupyter Notebook

- There are several errors in the template.yaml file in AWS Lambda Task Executor that make installation fail if they aren't changed
  - the AWS Policy AWSLambdaFullAccess has been changed to AWSLambda_FullAccess, so 'sam deploy' will fail to create the necessary roles.
  - The wrong Dask Dependency Layer is accessed by the file. It uses DaskDependenciesAndXRay:9, but should instead be DaskDependenciesAndXRay:6
  
- In client.py and worker.py, The current version of Dask does not allow for the 'apply' function to be imported from Dask.Compatibility. Downgrading to 1.2.2 appears to have solved the issue.
  - Should Import from Dask Utils instead
  
- In client.py, The current version of Dask does not allow for the 'unicode' variable to be imported from Dask.Compatibility. Downgrading to 1.2.2 appears to have solved the issue.
  - Add "unicode = str" to client.py
  
- In 'deploy/local.py', the current version of Dask does not allow for the 'factors' function to be imported from Dask.utils. Downgrading to 1.2.2 appears to have solved the issue.
  - Needed to reimplement Factors function. Have copied it over from old version of source file.

- distributed.yaml not installed with the rest of the items in Static Scheduler when installing library.

- Erroneous setup.py in main Wukong Folder.

- pathing.py and wukong_metrics.py not included in install. Had to be copied to installed Wukong library from my copy of the Wukong Repo.

- pathing and wukong_metrics not properly referenced from scheduler.py. After adding the above files to installed Wukong repo, I needed to add . before the names of both in the import statement (pathing -> .pathing, wukong-metrics -> .wukong-metrics)

- bokeh/theme.yaml not installed with the rest of the items in Static Scheduler when installing library.

- wukong-config.yaml not installed with the rest of the items in Static Scheduler when installing library.

wukong_config_path points to incorrect location (in Windows). Current working directory is set to Jupyter Notebook location, so it can't find the config file.

Must start Redis server yourself using Docker

bokeh/scheduler.py attempts to import value from bokeh.models. This no longer exists in newer versions of bokeh as far as I can 
 - Value originally from bokeh.core.property.dataspec. March 2, 2022 commit changed design extensively. Not sure if quick fix possible.
 - Installing an older version reveals cascading dependency issues in bokeh. Leving this problem on the table for now.
 
- When running .compute function, error "module 'base64' has no attribute 'encodestring'" appears
  - add in base64.encodestring = base64.encodebytes to scheduler.py

- Uninstalled dependencies: ntplib, redis, bokeh*, aioredis* (Must be before 2.0.0 currently)
